<p>I have decided to join the 100 days of code movement. I won't fork their repo and log it
since I already have this as my logger. That means I will have to keep posting what I did every
day!</p>

<p>Anyway, for today, I updated this blog and also prepared my SD card for my shiny new Raspberry Pi.
Gonna turn it into a RetroPi so I can play with all the games I played as a kid.</p>

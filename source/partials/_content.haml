    I aim to create web sites and applications that help people complete tasks faster.

    I started out as a front end / UI specialist but I have since expanded my skill set to include devops, back end, and even database optimization.

    I **LOVE** [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [HAML](http://haml.info/) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)!
